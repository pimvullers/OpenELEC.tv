ncurses-5.8/5.9:
  - segfaults in nano and dialog -> using ncurses-5.7

irserver:
  - rework irserver/init.d for systemd

settings addon:
  - remove ps3 sleep? should be fixed in bluez 5.13/5.14

systemd/xbmc:
  - find a way to disable suspend if {/flash,/storage} is NOT on fixed drive. suspend with nonpersistent / is broken by design.
