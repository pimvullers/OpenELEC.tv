ncurses-5.8/5.9:
  - segfaults in nano and dialog -> using ncurses-5.7

irserver:
  - rework irserver/init.d for systemd

nettle/gmp
  - ffmpeg shared build fails with gmp/nettle static (-fPIC?)
    so try-build gmp/nettle as static-only libs once xbmc/ffmpeg 
    is static linked and we drop ffmpeg package (or build it static)
